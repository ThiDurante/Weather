# **Hey there!!**

This project was created with **React** using **contextAPI** to manage state!

Its a simple weather app where you can search the location you want 😃

You can clone the repository, use npm i and after installation npm start to visualize locally.

Reviews and suggestions are always welcome 😁
Thank you.
