# **Hey there!!**

This project was created with **React** using **contextAPI** to manage state!

I used 2 apis from <a href="https://open-meteo.com/en">open-meteo</a>, one to convert the location name into coordinates and the main one to get the weather forecast for those coordinates

Its a simple weather app where you can search the location you want 😃

You can clone the repository, use **npm i** and after installation **npm start** to visualize locally.

Reviews and suggestions are always welcome 😁

### Thank you.
